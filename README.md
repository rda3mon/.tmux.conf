## Features

## Key bindings

The power of tmux comes from its configurability and every action can be controlled by key-bindings. Here are the list of keybindings which are configured with this configuration. `prefix` means <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd> pressed together.


* `prefix`: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd>. If you are using tmux, you are well aware of `prefix`.
* `prefix` + `?`: All of the key-bindings are availble here, you need not visit this page at all.
* `prefix` + `r`: Reload tmux config to pick up the latest one.

Session related bindings

* `prefix` + `$`: Rename session
* `prefix` + `d`: Detach the tmux session
* `prefix` + `s`: Show tmux sessions
* `prefix` + `(`: Switch previous session and rotate backwords
* `prefix` + `)`: Switch next session and rotate forwards

Window related bindings

* `prefix` + `c`: Create a new window and switch to it
* `prefix` + `n`: Rotate to next window
* `prefix` + `p`: Rotate to previous window
* `prefix` + `0` to `9`: To go to specific window

* `prefix` + `}`: To move pane right
* `prefix` + `z`: To toggle pane zoom
* `prefix` + `C-d`: Duplicate pane with copy command of what is currently running. Such as ssh into some instance. `C-d` means you have to press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd> together.
* `prefix` + `C-p`: Toggle logging of current pane to `/tmp/tmux_{pane_pid}.log`
* `prefix` + `C-s`: Toggle pane synchronisation. Meaning type on all panes together.

  * `v`: vi visual mode for text selection
  * `y`: vi copy text
  * `r`: vi rectangle copy
  * `q`: quit copy mode
  * `C-u`: Page up
